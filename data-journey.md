# Welcome to this repository on analyzing data!

In this repository I will try to document my journey towards learning how to analyze data. Nowadays, every one of us needs to analyze some data, even occasionally. To perform this task, most of us use a program like Excel, or something similar.  

For more advanced analysis though, there are more specialized software packages available, like the IBM SPSS, or other similar options.  

There are also customized programs that use raw log files (usually stored in a server) to analyze and produce meaningful graphs and key information, which will be used as a decision making tool by many companies.  

Some of these options though, are very expensive to be used by an individual or by a small company. Even students who would like to learn how to use such programs, usually have limited access to actually learn those software packages in depth.  

But even if someone manages to become an expert in these programs, most probably will have limited options to practice his or her skills, as in reality many companies cannot afford to own such specialized software.
