# Statistical foundations

The foundations of modern statistics were set by Sir Ronald Fisher, while he was working at the Rothamsted Experimental Station (later known as the Institute of Arable Crops Research, and today known as Rothamsted Research, which is located in Hertfordshire, England, and was founded in 1843).   

Sir Ronald Fisher was hired by the Rothamsted Experimental Station in 1919 in order to analyse the vast majority of data on agricultural cultivations that the Station had gathered since its beginning.  

ANOVA, as used today, was first introduced in 1925 by Sir Ronald Fisher in his book 'Statistical Methods for Research Workers'.  

Firstly, we need to understand the historical period when these things were taking place. The world population was increasing but the arable land was mostly constant and thus, the crop scientists needed to find new wheat varieties that would ensure a higher yield per hectare, in order to meet the increasing demand.  
Crop scientists were mostly focusing on wheat because is the most important food plant in Europe and in many other parts of the world, while in some countries the most important plants, besides wheat, are rice and corn.

So, the crop scientists needed a reliable and realtively easy way to distinguish the best wheat varieties out of the thousands wheat varieties that were cultivated experimentally. Scinetists wanted to assure that the new varities that would be selected and given to the farmers would produce an increased yield, otherwise it wouldn't make any sense to give lesser varieties to the farmers or even similar varieties to the existing ones.

Thus, Sir Ronald Fisher introduced the ANOVA analysis which, with simple calculations that obviously were performed by hand, gave the oppurtunity to the crop scientists to compare simultaneously hundred of varieties and being able to distinguish if there was at least one variety between them that was different from the existing cultivated variety, and then, more tests were perfored to distinguish that variety and find if was a promising variety to be used for future cultivation.

Othewise, if there no statisically siginificant differences in the ANOVA test, all those varieties were set aside and a new ANOVA test was performed for some other variities in order to find the best varieties for future cultivation.

This ANOVA analysis and a whole new aproach to the statistical methods, set the foundationds for the modern statistics and there many statistical methods that are used today and they have their origin in that age.
