# Statistical foundations

The foundations of modern statistics were set by Sir Ronald Fisher, while he was working at the Rothamsted Experimental Station (later known as the Institute of Arable Crops Research,    and today known as Rothamsted Research, which is located in Hertfordshire, England, and was founded in 1843).   

Sir Ronald Fisher was hired by the Rothamsted Experimental Station in 1919 in order to analyse the vast majority of data on agricultural cultivations that the Station had gathered since its beginning.  

ANOVA, as used today, was first introduced in 1925 by Sir Ronald Fisher in his book 'Statistical Methods for Research Workers'.
