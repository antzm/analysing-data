# Simple and brief introduction to Satistics


1.	Statistics has two branches. 

		1.	Descriptive statistics, that uses various methods to present data in useful and meaningful ways.  

		2.	Inference statistics, that uses information from samples to draw conclusions about populations.  


2.	In the vast majority of cases, population data are not available and thus, to be able to study a population, we take one or more samples from that population and using the methods of the inference statistics we make indirect conclusions about the population.


3.	The term population in statistics has a very broad meaning and can refer to a group of people, group of animals, group of plants or even to a group of any kind of items we could think of. The population is not something standardized, but is defined by the researcher, who uses some characteristics to describe who or what exactly belongs to the population which, he or she, is interested to study. Each one of those groups, should have some certain characteristics in order to belong to the population. We say, for example, that we are interested in the people who attend e-learning lessons on coding all over the world and so, this is our population which we are interested to study. We are interested, for example, to find out what is the average age of our population. Obviously. It’s not possible to ask every person around the world, who belongs to our population, about their age. First, we don’t actually know all the people who study coding using e-learning around the world, and even if we did, it would be too costly and time consuming to contact them all. Thus, we will only ask a few people around the world and based on their answers we will draw conclusions about the whole population of the coding e-learners.


4.	So, let’s say that we contacted 100 people around the world, and they told us their age. These 100 people is our sample, and based on our sample, we will estimate the age of our population. But how accurate would that be? Depends on the sampling technique we used, the size of the sample, and obviously, the quality of the analysis that we will perform. Note though that actually, the age of the population would always be unknown, and we can only estimate it, without ever knowing its actual value.


5.	When we don’t understand something, we may use the phrase “It’s all Greek to me”. Remember though that most people around the world understand English. Actually, the same thing happens with statistics. We understand the sample in the same way that we understand English, because sample is something known. But we don’t understand the population very well because is mostly unknown, in the same way that most people around the world don’t understand Greek.


6.	So, let’s use the above metaphor to remember that in statistics, all over the world, everything that refers to the population is always written with Greek letters, while everything that refers to the sample, is always written with English letters.


7.	Population: μ = population mean, σ = population variance, ρ = population correlation


8.	Sample: x bar (x with bar on top) = sample mean, s = sample variance, r = sample correlation


9. The population parameters, μ and σ, are actually estimates of the unknown population mean and the unknown population variance. So, μ and σ, are just estimates that are caluclated based on the sample or the samples that we have collected from the population.



10. For this reason, the sample collection and the sample size are very important, because they affect positively or negatively the information we have about the population. If we are using a wrong sampling technique, we will always have a wrong idea about the population we are interested in and thus, if we have to make a decision about that population, our decision would be wrong, although we may think that we are working towards the right direction.


11. One of the very few cases where we can check if the estimates that we have calculate for a population are actually correct, is during an election. And to be more precise, during the day of the elections, when we can actually see how close to the reality were the exit-polls. This is one of the very few times where the work of the statistician is actually tested for it's accuracacy in the real world. As we understand, if the statisticians, data scientsts, or data analyst who are responsible for those exit polls, choose a wrong sampling tecnique and / or a wrong analysis of the collected data, then their results will be far away from the real outcome of the elections.

12. Data Types
	* Quantitative Data
		* Continuous Quantitative Data
		* Discrete Quantitative Data
	* Categorical Data
		* Ordinal Categorical Data
		* Nominal Categorical Data

## Quantitative Data

Refers to data thatn can be measured and expressed in numbers. i.e.
	* Height
	* Weight
	* Speed
	* Volume
	* Income
	* Population
	* etc

Quantitative Data
	* Continuous Quantitative Data
	* Discrete Quantitative Data

### Continuous Quantitative Data

When the data can be expressed in decimal numbers
	* Speed
	* Income
	* Height
	* Weight

### Discrete Quantitative Data

When the data can be expressed only as natural numbers
	* Number of children
	* Number of people
	* Number of discrete items


## Categorical Data

Refers to data that cannot be measured and expressed in numbers. i.e.
	* Colour
	* Character
	* Creativity
	* Marital status
	* Gender
	* Occupation
	* etc.

Categorical Data
	* Ordinal Categorical Data
	* Nominal Categorical Data

### Ordinal Categorical Data

When the data have a logical order
	* Education (Highshool, College, University, Msc, Phd)
	* School grades, expressed as letters (A-, A, A+)

### Nominal Categorical Data

When there is no order logical order in the data
	* Gender
	* Colour
	* Occupation
