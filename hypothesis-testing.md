# Hypothesis Testing

When comparing numbers, it’s easy to conclude if two numbers are equal or not, and then, to find out which one is the greatest and which one is the smallest.  

In statistics though, things are completely different as we always compare a set of numbers with another set of numbers. We compare a set of numbers, that when put on a graph are distributed in a certain way, with another set of numbers, that when put on a graph are distributed in a different way. In other words, in statistics we always compare one distribution of numbers, with another distribution of numbers and we want to find out if those distributions are “equal”, or if they are different. And if the are different, which one is smallest, and which one is greatest.  

In statistics though, we cannot use the word equal to compare two distributions, as it’s practically impossible to compare two sets of numbers, that come from two different samples, and to find out that those sets are exactly the same.
For this reason, we use a very specialized and extremely important terminology in statistics:  

When something is “equal” in statistical terms, we say that there are no statistically significant differences between variable1 and variable2, although variable1 could be 10 and variable2 could be 100. Yes, they may look completely different but from the statistical point of view, there are no statistically significant differences between those two variables.  

On the other hand, we may have two variables with the value of 1,23 and 1,25 and to find out that those variables are statistically significant different i.e. not “equal” in statistical terms.
