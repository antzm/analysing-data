# Population vs Sample

When dealing with data, one of the first things we need to clarify is the difference between population and sample.  
The term population usually brings to mind the population of a country, but it could also refer to the population of a city, the population of a village or even the population of a University campus.  
In a similar way, it could also refer to the population of a certain region, the population of a continent or even the total population of the world.  


Thus, the term population is not something constant and predefined, but its precise context depends on what exactly we are referring to, or what exactly we are interested to study. 


Also, when we talk about population, most people will consider it as obvious that we are referring to people, but a zoologist specializing in elephants, may also use the term to refer to the population of the elephants in a certain region, country or continent. And in a similar manner, a botanist may use the same term to refer to the population of a certain scepies of a plant in a region.

In statistics though, the term population may refer not only to humans, animals or palnts but even to items and in fact, it may refer to any item we could think of.

For example, in a factory that produces smart-phones, we may refer to the total number of smart-phones produced as the population. In such a case, if we would like to test the phones and see if they are water resistant, for a few minutes in water, then it wouldn't be possible to test the entire population of the phones. In this case, we could take, for example, one phone out of every one thousand produced and then test that phone to see how many minutes it can operate when covered with water. Those phones would be our sample and based on the results we will get from those phones, we will draw our coclusions for the rest of the phones that we didn't test, and thus making assumptions for the whole population.
