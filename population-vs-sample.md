# Population vs Sample

When dealing with data, one of the first things we need to clarify is the difference between population and sample.  
The term population usually brings to mind the population of a country, but it could also refer to the population of a city, the population of a village or even the population of a University campus.  
In a similar way, it could also refer to the population of a certain region, the population of a continent or even the total population of the world.  
Thus, the term population is not something constant and predefined, but its precise context depends on what exactly we are referring to, or what exactly we are interested to study.  
Also, when we talk about population, most people will consider it as obvious that we are referring to people, but a zoologist specializing in elephants, may also use the term to refer to the population of the elephants in a certain region, country or continent.
