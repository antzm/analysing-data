# Population vs Sample

When dealing with data, one of the first things we need to clarify is the difference between population and sample.  
The term population usually brings to mind the population of a country, but it could also refer to the population of a city, the population of a village or even the population of a University campus.  
In a similar way, it could also refer to the population of a certain region, the population of a continent or even the total population of the world.  

Thus, the term population is not something constant and predefined, but its precise context depends on what exactly we are referring to, or what exactly we are interested to study. 


Also, when we talk about population, most people will consider it as obvious that we are referring to people, but a zoologist specializing in elephants, may also use the term to refer to the population of the elephants in a certain region, country or continent. And in a similar manner, a botanist may use the same term to refer to the population of a certain scepies of a plant in a region.

In statistics though, the term population may refer not only to humans, animals or palnts but even to items and in fact, it may refer to any item we could think of.

## Definition of a Population

The definition of a population, is solely upon the researcher who is trying to discover some new findings. Thus, a population can be defined in an infinite number of ways, depending on what exactly the researcher, the scientist or the data analyst is trying to analyse or discover.

## Example 1

For example, in a factory that produces smart-phones, we may refer to the total number of smart-phones produced as the population. In such a case, if we would like to test the phones and see if they are water resistant, for a few minutes in water, then it wouldn't be possible to test the entire population of the phones. In this case, we could take, for example, one phone out of every one thousand produced and then test that phone to see how many minutes it can operate when covered with water. Those phones would be our sample and based on the results we will get from those phones, we will draw our coclusions for the rest of the phones that we didn't test, and thus making assumptions for the whole population.

## Example 2

We're interesting to see how the exposure to the sun relates to the level of vitamin D, in the north and south region of a country. We could consider two populations:
	* The population on the north part of the country
	* The population on the south part of the country

But this study is interested only for the people who are above 18 years old, so that the results could be easisly compared with some similar studies in other countries.

Thus, the exact definition of the populations would be:
	* The population on the north part of the country, which is 18 years old and above.
	* The population on the south part of the country, which is 18 years old and above.

## Example 3

Crop scientists are always producing new varieties of crops with the purpose to distinguish the best varieties for future cultivation

In this case, we are interesting to compare the current variety that is being cultivated by the farmers with the new variety that we expect to cultivate in the future.

Thus, we will be comparing two populations:

Poluation 1 is the population that corresponds to every plant of the current variety that is being cultivated or that it will be cultivated by the farmer.

Population 2 is the population that corresponds to every plant of the new variety that is currently being cultivated by the scientist or that it will be cultivated by the farmers in the future.

So, in this case we will actually be studing and comparing two sets of seeds that correspond to different varieties.

The samples are the seeds that we will cultivate in order to mesaure their production, while the populations are the future plants that will emerge from the seeds that we will cultivate in the future.

## Population is Unknown - Sample is Known

In the vast majority of cases, population is something unknown but sample is always something known. 

There are though, a few rare instances, when we get to know the population and this an excellent oppurtunity for the statisticians, data-anasysts and data-scientists to see how well their inferences are reflected to the actual population.

The only cases when we actually know the population are during:
	* Elections
	* Referendums

The exit polls, which take place during the same day as the elections or the referndums, are the samples from where we try to estimate what the population would actually vote and later that day, we get to see what the population has actually voted and we can see how accurate the exit polls' predictions were.

In this case, the population are not all te registered the voters but more specifically, the voters who would actullay vote during the election day because only those people will determine the election's results.

As the voters change their opinion from time to time, the samples taken a few days ago (i.e. the gallops where samples of the voters were asked about the political party that they plan to vote) are not representative of the actual population, as it was defined above.

On the other hand, the exit polls truly represent a sampling of the population, because the voters are asked after they have already voted and based on that sample, we get predictions about the final results.

And actually, after a few hours we have one of the very rare circumnstances where we can actually test the sampling tecnique and the statistical methods used to predict the elections' results.

For this reason, it is very important for the companies that perform the exit polls to estimate their results as close as possible to the actual results, as this provides an isgight for the quality of work done in each company.  

Othewise, without any actual results to test -once in a while- our estimations, there's no proof that the statictical process we use is actually the best one suited for the particular situation.

## It's all Greek to me...

This phrase is used when someone doesn't understand something at all. This phrase could be of great importance in statistics because it reminds us that, as far as the population is concerned, the true knowelede of the population is something that we dond't actually understand and for this reason we could say that the population is all Greek to us...

Now, this may seem pequliar but it worths rembering this phrase because this way it would be easy to combine the letters of the Greek alphabet with the population. This, would help us to always remeber that whenever we meet Greek letters in statistics, then those letters refer always to the population.

Yes! In statistics, all the parameters of the population are always mentioned with Greek letters.

On the other hand, English language is something known to most people, in a similar way that a sample is known to the researchers. And this, helps us to combine the letters in the English alphabet with the sample.

Thus, in statistics, whenever we see English letters we will know that they always refer to a sample and whenever we see Greek letters, we will know that they always refer to the population.

Examples:

Population:
	* μ = population mean
	* σ = population standard deviation
	* ρ = population correlation

Sample:
	* x bar = sample mean
	* s = sample standard deviation
	* r = sample correlation
